                              <p>Elizabeth Peabody intended her images to be interactive. Along with the charts printed in her textbook, she designed workbooks that would allow each student to identify the major historical events of each era and then, one by one, color them in. Her belief was that, by creating “outlines to the eye,” her students would be able to conjure their own narratives of historical change.</p>

                              <p>Recreating Peabody’s interaction for the web is in many ways quite simple. From software like Adobe Photoshop, we understand the concept of the color picker; the mouse (or trackpad) has naturalized the click as a basic mode of interaction; and web programming languages like JavaScript allow us to translate the original interaction into algorithmic form.p>

                              <p>But the resultant images are much less familiar. What do we learn about history—or about visualization—by translating these events into abstraction? Does the image convey a general sense of the unfolding of historical time, as Peabody envisioned? Does it reflect the impressionistic way in which history is recalled from memory? Or something else altogether?</p>
