                    <p>What is the shape of history? Does it unfold along a path, proceeding from past to present? Does it cycle, repeating both triumphs and tragedies? Or is it something else altogether, a shape that reflects the complexities and ambiguities of recorded time?</p>

                    <p>When we give shape to history, we make choices that impact how we understand history itself. A timeline, for instance, reinforces our sense of history’s inevitable forward progression. A clocklike arrangement, on the other hand, suggests the cyclical nature of historical events. But what if the goal of giving shape to history were to allow each person, individually, to make sense of history for herself?</p>
                    <br>


                    <p>This was the goal of Elizabeth Peabody, the nineteenth-century writer, editor, educator, and activist. Drawing from a system developed in Poland earlier in the century, she devised a method of translating history into shape and color. She aimed to appeal to the mind’s eye—a phrase she herself employed—so that each viewer could create her own story to explain the events of the past.</p>
