                              <p>The unfamiliarity of Peabody’s grid is striking in contrast to the familiar form of the timeline. The same history, depicted in timeline form, assumes a comforting legibility: the unfolding of past to present, steadily punctuated by significant events</p>

                              <p>The conversion from grid to timeline is made possible, here, because of how each event is stored as data. Country, color, event type, and year; these are the elements that comprise what is, in effect, Peabody’s data structure. Once converted to data, the record of history can be visually represented in any number of different ways.</p>

                              <p>Comparing these four representations of the same set of events—as timeline, as data, as grid, and as text—we become alerted to how the representation of data truly matters. We also learn how each visual form reflects a particular sense of the historical record, and our role in the interpretation of it</p>
